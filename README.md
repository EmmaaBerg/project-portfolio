# portfolio
This project was to create the beginning of my portfolio. The page is built with only HTML and CSS. 
I had some problems with my link to the image-overlay part in the featured project section as well as the actual images of my projects so thats one thing I will continue 
working on to start with. I added some structure for articles about my thoughts on code which will be updated when I have something to publish. 
If I had more time this week I would have liked to learn more about accessibility and how to implement it in my code.
